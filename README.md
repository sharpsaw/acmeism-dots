==============

Acmeism strives to remove barriers set up by different programming languages.

One early project along these lines is [UniScript](https://github.com/acmeism/uniscript), and this repo will house scripts and configs for `.uni` files.

Currently
---------

Only sevvie's port of vim-coffee as
[uniscript-vim](https://github.com/acmeism/uniscript-vim)

More to follow once we figure out what kinds of cool stuff to make.
